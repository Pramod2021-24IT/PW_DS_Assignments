    "#### Ans 1.\n",
    "**Multithreading** is a programming technique that allows a single process to execute **multiple threads** concurrently. Each thread runs independently and can perform different tasks simultaneously. Here are some key points about multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Threads vs. Processes**:\n",
    "   - A **process** is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It has its own memory space, data, and execution context.\n",
    "   - A **thread** is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. It's the smallest unit of processing that can run independently within an operating system.\n",
    "   - Threads within a process share the same memory space, which makes inter-thread communication more straightforward compared to inter-process communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why Use Multithreading?**\n",
    "   - **Concurrency**: Multithreading allows you to perform multiple tasks concurrently. For example, a web server can handle multiple client requests simultaneously using threads.\n",
    "   - **Responsiveness**: In GUI applications, multithreading ensures that the user interface remains responsive even when performing time-consuming tasks (e.g., downloading files or processing data).\n",
    "   - **Resource Utilization**: On multi-core machines, multithreading can better utilize computational resources. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython (the standard Python interpreter), only one thread can execute Python code at a time. Therefore, multithreading is most useful for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing files, network communication) rather than CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python's Threading Module**:\n",
    "   - The primary module for handling threads in Python is called **`threading`**.\n",
    "   - It provides a simple and intuitive API for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**:\n",
    "   - The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python code simultaneously.\n",
    "   - Because of the GIL, Python threads are not suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require true parallelism. For CPU-bound tasks, consider using the `multiprocessing` module instead. "

    "The `threading` module in Python is used to create and manage threads, which allows a program to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process. Threads are a way to achieve parallelism, which can improve the performance of applications by doing more than one operation at the same time, especially when performing I/O-bound or high-latency operations.: Returns a list of all currently active `Thread` objects.\r\n",
