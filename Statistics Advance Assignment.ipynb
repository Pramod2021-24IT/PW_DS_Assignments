    "\n",
    "- **Mean Position**: The mean (or median) of the normal distribution is located at the center of the distribution. It is the point where the distribution is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Least Frequent Data**:\n",
    "  - **Extremes/Tails**: Data points that are far from the mean (i.e., in the left or right tails of the distribution) are the least frequent. As you move further away from the mean, the probability density decreases, making such extreme values less likely to occur.\n",
    "  - **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: The PDF of a normal distribution is highest at the mean and decreases as you move away from the mean in either direction. This results in fewer occurrences of data points that are far from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Representation:\n",
    "In a graphical representation of the normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Center**: The peak of the bell curve represents the mean and the most frequent data values.\n",
    "- **Tails**: The areas of the curve that taper off to the left and right of the peak represent the less frequent data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, values close to 0 are more frequent, while values like -3 or 3 are much less frequent. The further away you get from the mean (0), the less likely you are to find data points due to the tapering nature of the normal distribution's tails."
